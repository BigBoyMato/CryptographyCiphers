-- C++ implementation 

CryptographyCiphers (v.0.2)

-- some of the mathematical functions are taken from the open sources

-- only std used 

This is a C++ cryptography project, which consists of 5 ciphers along with their decryption. Functional programming used, a small menu is provided.
Some of the ciphers have recurrent versions.
